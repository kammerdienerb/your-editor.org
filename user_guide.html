            <h2 id="S1">Starting yed for the first time</h2>
                <tt>yed</tt> can be started by simply entering "yed" on the command line.
                <pre class="inline_code">
                    <span class="sl"><span class="prompt">$ </span>yed <span class="cmt"># run your editor</span></span>
                </pre>
                <h3 id="S1_1">Configuration</h3>
                    All configuration of <tt>yed</tt> by default starts with items located in <tt>~/.config/yed</tt>.
                    If this is your first time running <tt>yed</tt>, you should see a popup that looks like this:
                    <center><img style="margin: 10px" src="images/dot_yed_popup.png"/></center>
                    Hitting '<tt>y</tt>' will create this directory and fill it with a default configuration made up of a few items that are explained in the next sections.
                    You may see an additional popup asking you to update YPM (see <a href="#S6_1">this</a> section).
                <h3 id="S1_2">init.so</h3>
                    The root of any <tt>yed</tt> configuration is the file <tt>~/.config/yed/init.so</tt>. This file is simply another <tt>yed</tt> plugin that sets options, adds commands, etc.
                    It is different from other plugins only in that it is loaded automatically by <tt>yed</tt> at startup.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    If you allowed <tt>yed</tt> to create your <tt>~/.config/yed</tt> for you, you should see this file along with <tt>init.c</tt>, the source code for <tt>init.so</tt>.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Examining <tt>init.c</tt>, you should notice a few things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>It uses <tt>YEXE()</tt> to run <tt>yed</tt> commands.</li>
                        <li>It creates a command called <tt>recompile-init</tt>, which you can use to integrate changes you make to this file.</li>
                        <li>It loads a couple of plugins (<tt>ypm</tt> and <tt>yedrc</tt>).</li>
                        <li>It instructs <tt>yedrc</tt> to load the file <tt>~/config/.yed/yedrc</tt>.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3 id="S1_3">yedrc</h3>
                    <tt>yedrc</tt> is a plugin that allows you to source files that contain a sequence of <tt>yed</tt> commands and execute them.
                    Most simple configuration tasks such as loading plugins, setting variables, activating a style, etc. can be accomplished with <tt>yed</tt> commands and putting these in a <tt>yedrc</tt> file makes that easier since you don't have to recompile anything.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    However, configuration that requires any dynamic behavior such as setting variables to different values depending on the presence of a program on the system, or custom frame rules, are not possible just by calling commands.
                    You always have the option to program complex configuration in your <tt>init.c</tt> (or any plugin, for that matter).
                <h3 id="S1_4">Different Config Paths</h3>
                    When the environment variable <tt>YED_CONFIG_DIR</tt> is set, <tt>yed</tt> will use that directory instead of <tt>~/.config/yed</tt>.
                    Otherwise, if <tt>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</tt> is set, <tt>yed</tt> will search there.
                    <tt>~/.config/yed</tt> is used in any other case.
            <h2 id="S2">Running commands</h2>
                Most behavior in <tt>yed</tt> is command driven.
                This is true even at a basic level.
                For example, when you hit the right arrow key to move the cursor to the right, what is actually happening is that there is a key binding that maps the arrow key to the command <tt>cursor-right</tt>.
                That command uses the lower-level <tt>yed</tt> core code to get the cursor to the correct spot.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Commands can be invoked in the following ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Programmatically using <tt>YEXE()</tt>.</li>
                    <li>Through a key binding.</li>
                    <li>Simply typed in the command line.</li>
                </ul>
                By default, <tt>ctrl-y</tt> will bring you to the command line.
                (Notice, <tt>command-prompt</tt> is also just another command invoked by a key binding!)
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Once there, you can run any available command, including those provided by plugins.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                See the <a href="cmd_ref.html" target="_blank">Command Reference</a>.
            <h2 id="S3">Keybindings</h2>
                As mentioned in the previous section, commands can be bound to keystrokes and some already have corresponding bindings.
                However, you may want to add useful bindings or change the key map completely!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                To do this you can use the <tt>bind</tt> and <tt>unbind</tt> commands.
                For example, let's say you wanted to change the binding for <tt>command-prompt</tt> from the default <tt>ctrl-y</tt> to <tt>ctrl-x</tt>.
                To do that, you could issue the following commands:
                <pre class="inline_code">
                    <span class="sl"><span class="prompt">YED> </span>bind ctrl-x command-prompt</span>
                </pre>
                <pre class="inline_code">
                    <span class="sl"><span class="prompt">YED> </span>unbind ctrl-y</span>
                </pre>
                If you want those bindings to persist, you must add those commands to your configuration.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <span style="color: #53aa6f">NOTE</span>: It's important to do the commands in that order so that you can still access the command prompt to create the new binding!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <span style="color: #53aa6f">NOTE</span>: Some plugins (<tt>vimish</tt>, for example) add complex behavior on top of key bindings and may require that you use alternative commands for binding keys. Read the plugin documentation.
            <h2 id="S4">Buffers</h2>
                Buffers are units of text content that typically represent a file.
                To open a file in <tt>yed</tt>, you can either start <tt>yed</tt> and pass the path to the file as a command line argument:
                <pre class="inline_code">
                    <span class="sl"><span class="prompt">$ </span>yed my_file.txt</span>
                </pre>
                or, from within <tt>yed</tt>, use the <tt>buffer</tt> command:
                <pre class="inline_code">
                    <span class="sl"><span class="prompt">YED> </span>buffer my_file.txt</span>
                </pre>
                In either case the contents of <tt>my_file.txt</tt> should be displayed.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As you use <tt>yed</tt> to modify this text, you're manipulating the <i>buffer</i>, not the file.
                However, you can save the changes in the buffer back to the file on disk with the <tt>write-buffer</tt> command (default binding <tt>ctrl-w</tt>):
                <pre class="inline_code">
                    <span class="sl"><span class="prompt">YED> </span>write-buffer</span>
                </pre>
                Additionally there is the concept of a <i>special</i> buffer, which typically does NOT represent a file.
                By convention, special buffers start with the <tt>*</tt> character.
                Some examples of these are <tt>*bindings</tt>, <tt>*vars</tt>, <tt>*yank</tt>, and <tt>*log</tt>.
                Even though they are special, they are still just buffers, so to view one, you can use the <tt>buffer</tt> command.
                <pre class="inline_code">
                    <span class="sl"><span class="prompt">YED> </span>buffer *log</span>
                </pre>
                Running that will pull up the log that collects the activity of many systems, commands, and plugins running in <tt>yed</tt>.
                You may also notice that it is write-protected.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Many plugins add and implement functionality in special buffers.
            <h2 id="S5">Frames</h2>
                Frames are areas of the screen that show some part of a buffer.
                They are analogous to a "window", "pane", or "view".
                They can be created and manipulated programmatically or with the commands <tt>frame-new</tt>, <tt>frame-resize</tt>, and <tt>frame-move</tt>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If you start <tt>yed</tt> and open a new buffer, you should see its contents in a frame that takes up the whole screen.
                Opening more buffers does not create new frames, however.
                Instead it simply displays the new buffer in the same frame.
                The commands <tt>buffer-next</tt> and <tt>buffer-prev</tt> can be used to cycle through open buffers with the currently active frame.
                Additionally, running <tt>buffer</tt> with the name of an already open buffer will display that buffer in the active frame.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You can create as many frames as you would like and arrange them as you wish.
                Each frame can show different buffers or even the same buffer!
                Additionally frames can be split using the commands <tt>frame-vsplit</tt> and <tt>frame-hsplit</tt>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Your cursor may only be in one frame at a time (the "active" frame).
                When you have more than one frame, you can cycle between them with the <tt>frame-next</tt> and <tt>frame-prev</tt> commands.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Finally, a frame can be deleted with <tt>frame-delete</tt>.
                <br/>
                <span style="color: #53aa6f">NOTE</span>: Deleting a frame does not have any effect on the buffer it was displaying.
            <h2 id="S6">Variables</h2>
                <tt>yed</tt> variables are simple key/value string pairs that are used to configure various aspects of the editor and plugins.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                To set/unset variables, use the commands <tt>set</tt> and <tt>unset</tt>.
                The command <tt>get</tt> will print the value of the given variable.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                See the <a href="var_ref.html" target="_blank">Variable Reference</a>.
            <h2 id="S7">Styles</h2>
                To change <tt>yed</tt>'s colors and attributes, you can activate a style.
                <br/>
                Styles are generally created by plugins and activated by name using the <tt>style</tt> command.
                <pre class="inline_code">
                    <span class="sl"><span class="prompt">YED> </span>style monokai</span>
                </pre>
                <span style="color: #53aa6f">NOTE</span>: The only style available without plugins is called "default".
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Most available styles are written to use the full 16 million colors available in "truecolor" terminals when the variable <tt>truecolor</tt> is true (false by default).
                However, most of the styles will try to approximate their colors into the 256 color palette if <tt>truecolor</tt> is disabled (to varying degrees of success).
                <br/>
                Check this list to see if your terminal supports truecolor: <a href="https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728</a>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                To enable truecolor styles, set <tt>truecolor</tt> to a truthy value <i>before loading the style plugins</i>:
                <pre class="inline_code">
                    <span class="sl"><span class="kw">set</span> truecolor <span class="str">'yes'</span></span>
                    <span class="sl"><span class="kw">plugin-load</span> <span class="str">'ypm'</span> <span class="cmt"># if style plugins loaded by YPM</span></span>
                    <span class="sl"><span class="kw">plugin-load</span> <span class="str">'styles/gruvbox'</span> <span class="cmt"># or manually</span></span>
                    <span class="sl"><span class="kw">style</span> <span class="str">'gruvbox'</span></span>
                </pre>

            <h2 id="S8">Plugins</h2>
                Almost all advanced functionality is implemented by plugins.
                Plugins can be loaded and unloaded with the commands <tt>plugin-load</tt> and <tt>plugin-unload</tt>.
                When you try to load a plugin, <tt>yed</tt> will search the plugin in the paths listed by the command <tt>plugins-list-dirs</tt> (descending priority).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                To find out where a plugin is being loaded from, use the command <tt>plugin-path</tt>.
                <h3 id="S8_1">YPM</h3>
                    <tt>yed</tt> ships with a plugin manager called <tt>YPM</tt> that can optionally be used to find, download, and use plugins from a large collection of user-written plugins.
                    If the <tt>ypm</tt> plugin has been loaded, you may use the command <tt>ypm-menu</tt> to see a list of all available.
                    From there you can discover the plugins that you'd like and install them.
                    Plugins installed with <tt>ypm</tt> will automatically be loaded the next time you run <tt>yed</tt>, so there is no need to add <tt>plugin-load</tt> commands to your configuration.
